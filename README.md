#Dotfiles
Dotfiles for an Hyprland setup


Includes Hyprland, Waybar, and Rofi. These are mandatory

There are also config files for BetterDiscord, Firefox, and Kitty.


Most of these (Hyprland, Waybar, Rofi and Firefox) source one of three colour files, located in .config/colours/.

These files must be symlinked into various directories. More instructions are located in Install.md
